# WitchyWorlds Website

Static site for the WitchyWorlds Minecraft network. The pages live at the root:

- `index.html` – homepage with community overview and CTA links
- `rules.html` – server rules and expectations
- `servers.html` – active server listings with copy-to-clipboard IP buttons

## Assets

Place the PNG artwork for server cards under `assets/img/` with the following
filenames so the existing `<img>` tags continue to work:

- `server-atm10.png`
- `server-tts10.png`

The repository intentionally omits the image binaries. Upload your own artwork
when deploying the site. Aim for at least 960×540 resolution for crisp visuals.
